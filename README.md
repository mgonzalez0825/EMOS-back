# EMOS-back
The purpose in developing EMOS application was to provide a digital solution that addresses the issue of having  to deal with multiple databases, either physical or logical, in the process of managing employees within an organization . EMOS defines a unique MySQL database that stores all data related to employees and makes sorting , querying ,insertion and deletion to the database  an easy task due to the form data is organized and related within the MySQL EMOS relational schema.
The application will also give the user the ability to easily add and remove departments, jobs and employees within the organization. In addition, the client can assign employees to a supervisor or not supervisor role  and manage their work schedules.
